# üìÅ University Filesystem Builder

A desktop utility that generates an organized folder structure for university students ‚Äî structured by academic years, modules, and weeks, with separate folders for coursework, notes, and exam prep.

This is a small automation project written in python. The aim of the project is to create a simple application
capable of building a file system for a user - assuming they are a university student. As it stands, 
the application assumes that the user has no university directory at all, and so creates a new one in the
users home directory. This application has yet to be tested on MAC and Linux BUT should work...

Here is a link to my trello board for this project if youd like to see where I am up to:
