This is a small automation project written in python. The aim of the project is to create a simple application
capable of building a file system for a user - assuming they are a university student. As it stands, 
the application assumes that the user has no university directory at all, and so creates a new one in the
users home directory. This application has yet to be tested on MAC and Linux BUT should work...

For more of a description for how to use this application, read INSTRUCTIONS.md

Plans:

- [ ] Allow for creation of one year at a time in a specified directory
- [X] Take number of weeks each semester has and build folders for each week
- [X] Directories for other, clubs and societies 
- [X] Simple GUI, more user friendly
- [X] Modules have week by week, coursework, notes, exam prep dirs
