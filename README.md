This is a small automation project written in python. The aim of the project is to create a simple application
capable of building a file system for a user - assuming they are a university student. As it stands, 
the application assumes that the user has no university directory at all, and so creates a new one in the
users home directory. 

Plans:

- [ ] Allow for creation of one year at a time in a specified directory
- [ ] Take number of weeks each semester has and build folders for each week
- [ ] Directories for other, clubs and societies 
- [ ] Simple GUI, more user friendly
- [ ] Modules have week by week, coursework, notes, exam prep dirs
